Problems are mostly taken from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/).
I also added one problem that Google had as an example interview question.

Iâ€™m guessing this will not help anyone, because their are already many solutions to these problems available online. 
But I still thought I might as well publish it, just in case my solution can help out anyone.
